This is a dumpground of useful snippets of Python functions that was used to carry out some mundane daily tasks.
Most them have been battle tested through actual implementation in various projects.  

## PUFolder
* Recursively list folder content, check if it is empty, smart create, get aboslute path, flat copy contents out from, randomly draw from a folder etc.   

## PUFile
* delete list of files, flat copy, get_timestamped, guarnteed unique file name, check name, duplicate into folders, zipping, retreieve function names, etc

## PUDateTime
* a loose collection of utility to manulate data to and from ISO to string, etc. 

Many of these tasks are probably slightly crappily wrapped version of system script that is already available. 



#####Do not use files not prefixed by PU as their common name WILL cause module conflict 
I assume no responsibility whatsoever if this breaks anything, something, whatever as there is currently no centrally coordinate effort to organize them.
